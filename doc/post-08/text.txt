In the fast-paced and ever-changing field of optimisation and mathematical programming, clarity and flexibility are paramount to effectively solve complex problems. One tool that has demonstrated consistent excellence in this area is AMPL (A Mathematical Programming Language).

The objective of the present design is to establish a connection between mathematical models and computational solutions. AMPL provides a 𝗻𝗮𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗮𝗹 𝘀𝘆𝗻𝘁𝗮𝘅 that enables practitioners to depict optimisation problems in their original form. The use of intuitive, algebraic-style notation facilitates the description of objectives, constraints and decision variables in a variety of contexts, including supply chain modelling, financial portfolio optimisation and logistics challenges.

The merits of AMPL extend far beyond its elegant syntax. Its most significant feature is its 𝗺𝗼𝗱𝘂𝗹𝗮𝗿 𝗱𝗲𝘀𝗶𝗴𝗻, which allows users to define models and data separately. This feature facilitates the modification, scaling and maintenance of optimisation problems. For instance, if constraints require adjustment or datasets are updated, it is not necessary to rebuild, which is a significant advantage when dealing with the complexity of modern optimisation tasks.

Another salient feature of AMPL is its 𝘀𝗼𝗹𝘃𝗲𝗿-𝗮𝗴𝗻𝗼𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗰 𝗮𝗿𝗰𝗵𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗰𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲. The software integrates a variety of solvers, including open-source and commercial options such as Gurobi, CPLEX and HiGHS, providing users with the flexibility to experiment with different algorithms and technologies to tailor solutions to the specific needs of their problem. 

The ability to develop and assess models using 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝘁𝗼𝘁𝘆𝗽𝗲 𝗳𝗿𝗮𝗺𝗲𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗸𝘀 and to evaluate their performance against various solvers is of immense value to researchers, analysts and operations teams. In a wide range of fields, including but not limited to energy, transportation, manufacturing and finance, AMPL facilitates the construction of robust mathematical models, allowing users to focus on their core competencies without being encumbered by technical intricacies.

As the challenges we face become increasingly complex, it is imperative that the tools we utilise to address them also advance. AMPL exemplifies how 𝗰𝗮𝗿𝗲𝗳𝘂𝗹 𝗱𝗲𝘀𝗶𝗴𝗻 and flexibility can enhance the efficiency and accessibility of mathematical programming.

If you are interested in AMPL, I recommend the book written by R. Fourer, D.M. Gay, B.W. Kernighan 𝗔𝗠𝗣𝗟 𝗔 𝗠𝗼𝗱𝗲𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗟𝗮𝗻𝗴𝘂𝗮𝗴𝗲 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗠𝗮𝘁𝗵𝗲𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗴𝗿𝗮𝗺𝗺𝗶𝗻𝗴 https://ampl.com/wp-content/uploads/BOOK.pdf which is available free of charge on the AMPL web site.
